Homepage Content Redesign - Implementation Plan
Overview
Transform homepage from personal metrics to industry-validated problem/solution narrative with 11 credible statistics, remove testimonials, merge sections, and add visual effects.
Phase 1: Content Removal & Restructuring
1.1 Remove Testimonials Section
Delete: Entire testimonials section (~lines 469-497 in page.tsx)
Impact: Removes 6 testimonial cards and section wrapper
Rationale: No verified testimonials available yet
1.2 Remove Week Numbers from Process Section
Modify: Process section (~lines 381-423)
Change: Remove "Week 0", "Weeks 1-4", "Weeks 5-8" from phase labels
Keep: Step numbers (1, 2, 3) and all deliverables
New labels: "Discovery & Audit", "Stabilize Production", "Instrument & Hand Off"
Phase 2: Create Unified "The Crisis" Section
2.1 Replace "Proof over Pitch" + Merge "Why Teams"
Current: Two separate sections (Results + Approach) New: Single unified section - "The Revenue Operations Crisis" Content Structure:
THE CRISIS SECTION
├─ Heading: "The breaking points"
├─ Subheading: "Your Salesforce chaos isn't unique. The data proves it."
├─ Industry Stats Cards (4 featured stats - Option B format)
│  ├─ Card 1: "91%" - CRM data decays annually
│  ├─ Card 2: "$12.9M" - Average annual cost of poor data quality
│  ├─ Card 3: "72%" - Time sales reps spend NOT selling
│  └─ Card 4: "30%" - SaaS spend wasted on unused tools
├─ Transition text: "Most consultants pitch $200K rebuilds..."
├─ Your Differentiators (4 existing cards from "Why Teams")
│  ├─ Principal-only execution
│  ├─ Transparency baked in
│  ├─ Operations-first rigor
│  └─ Designed to stick post-engagement
└─ Your Results (3 existing metric cards with benchmark comparisons)
   ├─ ±3% forecast variance vs. "Industry: 45% within 5%"
   ├─ -62% backlog reduction vs. "Industry: grows 15-20% annually"
   └─ $200K rebuild avoided vs. "Average rebuild: $50K-$200K"
Phase 3: Signals Section Enhancement
3.1 Rename to "The Breaking Points"
Change: Section title from "Signals" to "The breaking points"
Update: aria-label and heading ID
3.2 Add Ripple Alarm Effect (Option C)
Technical Implementation:
CSS keyframe animation: Cyan ripple emanates from card center
Animation properties:
Duration: 3 seconds
Easing: ease-out
Iteration: infinite
Scale: 0.8 → 1.2
Opacity: 0.6 → 0
Trigger: Always active (continuous slow pulse)
Accessibility: Respects prefers-reduced-motion
Visual Effect:
@keyframes ripple-alarm {
  0% { transform: scale(0.8); opacity: 0.6; }
  100% { transform: scale(1.2); opacity: 0; }
}
3.3 Add Industry Stats to Signal Cards
Overlay relevant stat on each signal card:
Forecast drift → "Only 45% of forecasts accurate within 5%"
Automations cascade → "23% of tech budget wasted on legacy maintenance"
Integrations blame → "86% cite integration as top challenge"
Backlog balloons → "Sales teams spend 72% of time NOT selling"
Phase 4: Statistics Implementation
4.1 Create Stat Card Component
Visual Format (Option B):
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   [Large Number: 91%]   │
│   in cyan, 4xl size     │
│                         │
│   CRM data decays       │
│   annually              │
│                         │
│   Source: ZoomInfo 2024 │
│   (small text, hover)   │
└─────────────────────────┘
4.2 Featured Statistics (4 cards)
91% - CRM data decays annually (ZoomInfo, 2024)
$12.9M - Average annual cost of poor data quality (Gartner, 2021)
72% - Time sales reps spend NOT selling (Salesforce, 2024)
30% - SaaS spend wasted on unused tools (Productiv, 2024)
4.3 Citation Implementation (Options A & C)
Inline Links (Option A):
Source text is clickable link
Links to placeholder URLs (to be updated with actual sources)
Hover Tooltips (Option C):
Hover over source text shows full citation
Tooltip includes: Full report title, organization, year, URL
Example:
<a 
  href="#" 
  className="text-cyan/80 hover:text-cyan text-xs"
  title="Source: 'The State of CRM Data in 2024' - ZoomInfo Research, 2024. Click for full report."
>
  (ZoomInfo, 2024)
</a>
Phase 5: FAQ Enhancement
5.1 Add "See More FAQs" Link
Location: Bottom of FAQ section, centered Link destination: /faq Styling: Cyan text with arrow, hover effect
<div className="mt-8 text-center">
  <Link 
    href="/faq" 
    className="inline-flex items-center gap-2 text-cyan hover:text-blue transition"
  >
    See all FAQs
    <svg>→</svg>
  </Link>
</div>
5.2 Create /faq Placeholder Page
New file: app/faq/page.tsx Content:
Hero section: "Frequently Asked Questions"
Placeholder text: "More FAQs coming soon. For now, email drew@revelateops.com"
Link back to homepage
Uses existing layout/navigation
Phase 6: Visual Effects & Animations
6.1 Ripple Alarm Effect (for "The Breaking Points")
CSS animation added to globals.css
Applied to signal cards as pseudo-element
Respects reduced motion preference
Cyan color (#00d9ff) at 40% opacity
6.2 Stat Card Animations
Fade-in on scroll (Framer Motion)
Stagger delay: 100ms between cards
Subtle scale on hover (1.02x)
