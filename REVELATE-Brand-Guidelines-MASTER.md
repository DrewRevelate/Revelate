## Brand Foundation

### Our Mission

We believe that every business, regardless of size or resources, deserves the power to harness their data for strategic growth. We break down the barriers in understanding and utilizing revenue operations, providing accessible and expert-driven solutions.

### Brand Emotions

Revelate Operations evokes two primary emotions in everything we create:

#### **TRUST (70%)**
- Reliability and expertise
- Professional partnership
- Methodical precision

#### **AMAZEMENT (30%)**
- Breakthrough insights
- Revelation moments
- Transformative discovery

### Visual Strategy

**"Navy anchors, Cyan amazes"**

Our brand balances the grounding professionalism of deep navy with the energetic revelation of vibrant cyan—creating an identity that says "We're the reliable partner who reveals incredible insights you didn't know existed."

### Brand Story

Our colors tell a story:
- **Navy:** The deep space of unexplored data—mysterious but not chaotic, rich with hidden potential
- **Cyan:** The moment the constellation emerges from scattered stars—sudden clarity, the pattern revealed
- **Magenta:** That spark of elation—the "I can't believe we didn't see this before!" moment

> *"Like a seasoned guide leading into an undiscovered cave, where reliable torchlight suddenly illuminates ancient crystals that take your breath away."*

- Format: SVG with proper viewBox attribute

**Recommended Icon Families:**
- Lucide Icons (customizable, MIT licensed)
- Heroicons (Tailwind, MIT licensed)
- Feather Icons (minimal, MIT licensed)

### Custom Icons

**When to Create:**
- Revelate-specific service offerings
- Unique RevOps concepts
- Brand-specific visualizations

**Guidelines:**
- Match 2px line weight
- Navy and cyan only
- 24px × 24px artboard
- Export as SVG with proper viewBox
- Maintain optical balance

### Animation

**Principles:**
- Subtle and purposeful only
- Duration: 200-300ms
- Easing: ease-in-out
- Use for: Hover states, transitions, loading

## Writing Style

### Grammar & Mechanics

**Capitalization:**
- Sentence case for headings
- "Revenue operations" lowercase (unless starting sentence)
- "Revelate Operations" always capitalized

**Numbers:**
- Spell out one through nine
- Numerals for 10+
- Numerals for all percentages: "5% improvement"
- Commas in large numbers: "1,000"
- Use "$" symbol: "$50K"

**Abbreviations:**
- "RevOps" acceptable after first "Revenue Operations" use
- CRM, API, ROI — no explanation needed
- Avoid excessive abbreviations

**Punctuation:**
- Oxford comma: Always
- Em dashes—no spaces
- Ellipses for trailing thought...
- Single space after periods

### Terminology

**Preferred:**
- "Revenue operations" or "RevOps"
- "Fractional" (not "part-time")
- "Data analysis" (not "analytics" usually)
- "Insights" (not "learnings" or "takeaways")

**Avoid:**
- Buzzwords: synergy, paradigm, leverage (as verb), rockstar, ninja
- Consultant jargon: deliverables, circle back, move the needle
- Vague claims: world-class, cutting-edge, revolutionary

### Content Formatting

**Lists:**
- Use for 3+ related items
- Parallel structure
- Periods if full sentences, none if fragments
- Keep items roughly equal length

**Headings:**
- Sentence case: "How we work" not "How We Work"
- Descriptive, not clever: "Pricing" not "Investment in growth"

**Links:**
- Descriptive text: "View our case studies"
- Never: "Click here," "Learn more" without context

### Call-to-Action Language

**Strong CTAs:**
- "See what you're missing" (discovery-focused)
- "Get your free revenue assessment" (value-first)
- "Book a consultation" (clear action)
- "Uncover hidden opportunities" (benefit-driven)

**Weak CTAs:**
- "Submit" (generic)
- "Click here" (no context)
- "Learn more" (vague)
- "Contact us" (effort-focused)

## Quality Gate Audit

### Overview

Before launching any website, landing page, or digital design, run it through this audit to ensure it feels authentically Revelate—not generic AI-generated. This checklist is the authoritative quality standard for all Revelate digital design work.

**Scoring:** 50-56 = Excellent | 45-49 = Good | 40-44 = Acceptable | 35-39 = Needs Work | <35 = Restart

---

### 1. Visual Design Audit (10 points)

**Color Usage:**
- [ ] Does the design use Revelate Navy (#1a1f3a) as the dominant color (60-70% of composition)?
- [ ] Is Revelate Cyan (#00d9ff) used strategically for highlights and insights (20-30%), not as a background flood?
- [ ] Is Magenta (#d946ef) used sparingly for critical CTAs only (5-10% maximum)?
- [ ] Are gradients ONLY used in the logo, nowhere else? (Subtle single-color gradients in navy/cyan acceptable)

**Visual Elements:**
- [ ] Does the design include the cosmic/constellation visual metaphor OR a new brand-specific pattern (not generic shapes)?
- [ ] Are shadows subtle (max 12px blur) using navy at 8% opacity, NOT heavy black shadows?
- [ ] Are left borders AVOIDED entirely? (Left borders on cards/alerts are a forbidden AI pattern)
- [ ] Are corner radiuses consistent with our system (4px-12px), not excessively rounded (24px+)?
- [ ] Is there generous but purposeful white space that creates hierarchy, not just emptiness?
- [ ] Does the design avoid glassmorphism, excessive gloss, or trendy effects?

**Visual Design Score: ___ / 10**

---

**Font Usage:**
- [ ] Are ALL headings using Space Grotesk (Bold 700, Semibold 600, or Medium 500)?
- [ ] Is ALL body text using Inter (Regular 400, Medium 500, or Semibold 600)?

**Typography Score: ___ / 8**

---

### 3. Content & Voice Audit (10 points)

**Specificity & Proof:**
- [ ] Are value propositions specific with data? ("$847K recovered" not "increase revenue")
- [ ] Do testimonials include specific outcomes and context, not generic "Great product!"?
- [ ] Are timeframes and metrics quantified? ("30% improvement in 90 days" not "fast results")
- [ ] Does every claim have proof? (Client count, case study, methodology reference)

**Voice Consistency:**
- [ ] Does the copy sound like Revelate? (Clear, confident, insightful, data-grounded)
- [ ] Does it avoid buzzwords? (No "revolutionary," "game-changing," "synergy," "leverage" as verb)

- [ ] Does it use active voice? ("We identified" not "Opportunities were identified")

**Messaging Quality:**
- [ ] Are CTAs using Revelate voice? ("See what you're missing" not "Learn more" or "Click here")

**Content Score: ___ / 10**

---

### 4. Layout & Composition Audit (7 points)

**Layout Uniqueness:**

- [ ] Is there strategic asymmetry or are elements thoughtfully off-center (not everything centered)?
- [ ] Does the hero section avoid the generic 100vh centered heading + CTA formula?
- [ ] Are image-text sections varied, not just alternating left/right?

**Grid & Spacing:**
- [ ] Does the layout follow our 12-column grid system (desktop), 8-column (tablet), 4-column (mobile)?
- [ ] Is spacing consistent using our 8px-based scale (16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px, 96px)?
- [ ] Is responsive design thoughtfully crafted for mobile, not just "desktop stacked"?

**Layout Score: ___ / 7**

---

- [ ] Are animations purposeful, not excessive or distracting?

**Interactive Score: ___ / 6**

---

### 6. Code Quality Audit (5 points)

- [ ] Is the design performant on mobile (no excessive animations, large payloads)?

**Code Score: ___ / 5**

---

### 7. Brand Personality & Differentiation Audit (10 points)

**Storytelling:**
- [ ] Is there evidence of Revelate's origin story or mission (beyond generic "about us")?
- [ ] Are customer journeys shown with before/after transformation?
- [ ] Are examples specific? ("Sarah Chen, Head of Demand Gen at Series B SaaS" not "Sarah, marketing manager")

**Unique Elements:**
- [ ] Does the design include at least ONE element that competitors don't use?
- [ ] Is the Trust/Amazement ratio appropriate for the page type? (Proposals 95/5, Website 70/30)
- [ ] Are visuals brand-specific (cosmic theme, data visualization style) not stock photos?

**Anti-Generic:**
- [ ] Would a user recognize this as Revelate if the logo was removed?
- [ ] Does it avoid the "startup landing page formula"? (alternating sections, three features, big hero)
- [ ] Is the solution context-specific for RevOps, not a generic "transform your business" template?
- [ ] Does it pass the "Competitor Inverse" test? (Check 3 competitors—are we doing something different?)

**Brand Personality Score: ___ / 10**
