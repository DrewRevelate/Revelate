# Design Thinking Session: Revelate Operations Website Redesign

**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Facilitator:** Drew
**Design Challenge:** Authentic Brand Expression Through Subtle Space Aesthetic

---

## 🎯 Design Challenge

### Problem/Opportunity

The Revelate Operations website is technically well-built but feels visually overdone and tonally misaligned with the brand's authentic identity. The current aesthetic leans "80s vision of the future" rather than the intended subtle, elegant space theme. It's trying too hard to look futuristic/techy instead of projecting quiet confidence and personal expertise.

### Primary Users

- Sales Leaders at B2B SaaS companies (30-150 sellers)
- Revenue Operations Leaders dealing with scaling pain
- Founders of startups facing Salesforce complexity

### Constraints

- **Time**: Need to begin funneling business immediately - can't afford long redesign cycles
- **Brand integrity**: Must feel authentic to Revelate's identity as a trusted advisor
- **Conversion focus**: Every change must maintain/improve path to booking

### Success Definition

- High conversion rates (visitors → scheduled calls)
- Custom package interest and engagement
- Meetings booked with qualified leads
- Trust established before first conversation
- Visitors feel: "Finally someone who gets it AND knows their shit"
- Emotional response: Trust + Wow factor + Possibility

### Core Design Question

**How do we refine the Revelate website to project sophisticated confidence and personal expertise through a subtle space aesthetic—building trust and sparking possibility—without the visual overwhelm that currently obscures the brand's authentic identity?**

---

## 👥 EMPATHIZE: Understanding Users

### Current Experience (What Visitors Get Now)

**THINK:**
- "What does he actually do?" (immediate confusion at hero)
- "These 4 cards are nice but what's the ONE thing I need to know?"
- "Why is this stat here? What's the connection to the outcome?"
- "Boutique = small/old/childish? Not serious enough?"
- "This comparison section looks different—style disconnect"
- "Can't compare apples to apples in this layout"
- "Sprint section exists... so what's my takeaway?"
- "FAQ is eating up so much screen space, wish I could search it"

**FEEL:**
- Confused (messaging unclear)
- Overwhelmed (too much, no visual hierarchy)
- Skeptical (boutique language + visual overdone = trying too hard)
- Disconnected (style inconsistency between sections)
- Passive (just scrolling, not engaging)

**DO:**
- Scroll passively without clicking anything
- Don't pause anywhere meaningful
- Looking for "the point" but not finding it
- Likely bounce or give up before booking

**SAY:**
- "I think he does Salesforce consulting? But not sure what specifically..."
- "This looks expensive and complicated"
- "Is this guy legit or just good at design?"

---

### Desired Experience (What You Want Them To Feel)

**THINK:**
- "What can this guy offer ME?" ← Answered immediately with visual signals
- "Oh, he knows SFDC deeply—I can see the tools and proof"
- "He knows AI, data, reporting—visual verification right here"
- "I get it. Clear. Next section—what's this about? Got it in 7 seconds."
- "I want to know more about [X]—oh, I can click for details"

**FEEL:**
- **Trust**: Visual signals verify expertise instantly, no need to "sell"
- **Wow factor**: Sophisticated design that doesn't overwhelm
- **Possibility**: "This person can solve my specific problem"
- Confident (clear what you offer and how it helps)
- Engaged (choosing to dive deeper on what matters to them)

**DO:**
- **Land** → See immediate capability signals (tools, skills, visual proof)
- **Scan** → Grasp each section's point in under 7 seconds
- **Click** → Progressive disclosure for deeper detail when interested
- **Understand** → Know exactly what you offer and how it helps
- **Feel confident** → Trust established through clarity + visual proof
- **Book call** → High-intent action because uncertainty is removed

**SAY:**
- "Okay, this guy clearly knows his stuff—I can see it"
- "I can see exactly what he does and what tools he masters"
- "This feels right for my problem—let me book a call"

---

### Key Observations

**The Empathy Gap:**
- **Current**: Text-heavy, try to explain everything, hope they read it all
- **Desired**: Visual-first, show capabilities through signals, let them choose depth

**Visual Hierarchy Crisis:**
- **Current**: No clear hierarchy—everything feels equally important (nothing stands out)
- **Desired**: 7-second rule—every section communicates its core point immediately

**Trust Signals:**
- **Current**: "Boutique" language and overwrought visuals signal "trying too hard"
- **Desired**: Confident signals that verify expertise without excessive explanation

**The Core Pattern:**
Drew is a principal consultant who **shows** expertise through work, not words. The site should mirror that philosophy: **Visual proof > Verbose promises**. Show the tools, show the capabilities, show the expertise—then let visitors choose to dive deeper if they want more detail.

### Empathy Map Summary

**What visitors need:** Immediate clarity on capabilities → Visual proof of expertise → Fast scanning with optional depth → Confidence to book

**What they're getting:** Text walls → Unclear hierarchy → Stylistic inconsistency → Passive scrolling experience

**The transformation needed:** From "read everything to understand" to "scan visually, understand instantly, click for more if interested"

---

## 🎨 DEFINE: Frame the Problem

### Point of View Statement

**Busy RevOps and Sales Leaders visiting the Revelate site need to instantly verify Drew's expertise and understand his specific capabilities because they're overwhelmed by their current tech debt and can't afford to waste time decoding vague consultant promises—they need visual proof and clear signals, not marketing copy.**

### How Might We Questions

- **HMW** make capabilities instantly scannable without reading paragraphs?
- **HMW** show tool expertise visually instead of listing it in text?
- **HMW** create a 7-second understanding for every section?
- **HMW** use progressive disclosure so visitors control depth?
- **HMW** reduce visual overwhelm while maintaining sophisticated space aesthetic?
- **HMW** replace "boutique" language with signals of serious, principal-level expertise?
- **HMW** create style consistency across all sections?
- **HMW** guide visitors from trust → understanding → booking in one seamless flow?

### Key Insights

**The Real Problem:**
This isn't about "making it prettier." It's about **trust architecture**. Your visitors arrive skeptical and time-constrained. They need to answer "Can this person solve MY problem?" in seconds, not minutes.

**Success Criteria:**
That stressed VP lands on your site → sees immediate capability signals (tools, expertise, proof) → scans through sections that communicate their point in under 7 seconds → feels confident you understand their world → books a call. All within 2 minutes of landing.

**The Core Tension:**
You need to project both **sophistication** (wow factor) AND **clarity** (7-second rule). Most sites choose one or the other. Revelate needs both—elegant space aesthetic that doesn't obscure the message.

**The Design Philosophy:**
Show, don't tell. Visual proof > Verbose promises. Progressive disclosure > Information dump. Trust signals > Marketing claims.

## 💡 IDEATE: Generate Solutions

### Selected Methods

**Brainstorming + SCAMPER Framework** - We used divergent thinking to generate 40+ ideas across six problem areas, then converged on the breakthrough concepts that align with Revelate's authentic identity.

### Generated Ideas (Organized by Theme)

#### Theme 1: DYNAMIC CAPABILITY SIGNALS (Hero/Entry)
- Animated tool logos that **explode from behind logo** as user scrolls
- Tool logos that **rotate through neatly** on hero
- **Responsive/dynamic tagline** that adapts to visitor behavior
- Tech stack bar showing platforms you master
- Capability badges visible immediately (GitHub profile style)
- Photo + overlay of tools/platforms around you
- Problem signals → "I fix this" reveal

#### Theme 2: EXCLUSIVITY POSITIONING (Brand Tone) ⭐ SELECTED
- **Large logo as entry point** for polish/exclusivity
- Emphasize **selective, principal-led** nature
- "Principal-Led Model" vs "Boutique"
- "Embedded Partner" positioning
- Display **breadth of industries** worked with
- Case studies showing **concrete client wins**
- "Currently Working With" logos (anonymized)

#### Theme 3: SIMPLIFIED HIERARCHY (7-Second Rule) ⭐ SELECTED
- **ONE hero differentiator** + "Learn More" expansion
- Icon-first design: Big icon + 5-word headline
- Headline + 3 bullets + optional expansion
- Expandable "Why this matters >" for every section
- Eliminate everything that doesn't pass 7-second test
- Sticky nav showing section context as you scroll
- **Parallax scrolling** for engagement

#### Theme 4: VISUAL COMPARISON CLARITY (Others vs You)
- Your approach LEFT (primary) vs traditional RIGHT (what to avoid)
- Side-by-side bullets that map 1:1 (apples to apples)
- Icon comparison matrix (✓ vs ✗)
- Clean grid, easy scanning
- Combine comparison + testimonial quotes
- **New display methods** beyond cards

#### Theme 5: REFINED SPACE AESTHETIC (Sophistication Without Overwhelm) ⭐ SELECTED
- **Eliminate 75% of gradients/blur effects**
- Reduce blur intensity (170px → 80px)
- Substitute heavy gradients with **subtle grid/constellation dots**
- One signature gradient per page, not every section
- Adapt from Stripe/Linear: restrained sophistication
- Add **parallax scrolling** for engagement (motion without chaos)

#### Theme 6: OUTCOMES WITH CONTEXT
- Lead with YOUR outcome, industry context as sub-text
- Case study cards with visual graphs
- Outcome + client logo + metric in one card
- Display all industries you serve
- Concrete wins vs abstract stats

### Top Concepts (Selected for Prototyping)

#### Concept B: "Exclusive Principal" Positioning
**The WHAT - Positioning/Messaging**

Lean INTO exclusivity as a strength rather than apologizing for boutique scale. Position Revelate as a selective, principal-led practice that takes 2-3 clients at a time for deep focus. Use large logo as entry point, emphasize breadth of industries served, showcase concrete client wins, and replace "boutique" language with "Principal-Led" or "Embedded Partner" terminology.

**Why this works:** Exclusivity signals expertise. Busy executives trust specialists who are selective about engagements—it means you're in demand and protective of quality.

---

#### Concept C: "Progressive Disclosure + Motion"
**The HOW - Interaction Design**

Every section follows a consistent pattern: Bold headline (7-second comprehension) → 3 supporting bullets → Optional "Learn More" expansion for depth. Add parallax scrolling for engagement. Implement sticky navigation showing context. Remove anything that doesn't pass the 7-second test.

**Why this works:** Respects visitor time while offering depth on demand. Motion creates engagement without overwhelming. Visitors control their journey.

---

#### Concept E: "Restrained Space Aesthetic"
**The LOOK - Visual Design**

Eliminate 75% of blur effects and gradient orbs. Reduce blur intensity from 170px to 80px. Use one signature gradient per page maximum. Substitute heavy gradients with subtle constellation patterns or grid overlays. Adapt the restrained sophistication of Stripe or Linear—elegant space theme without the cyberpunk overwhelm.

**Why this works:** Sophistication through restraint. The space aesthetic becomes elegant NASA mission control rather than 80s sci-fi. Visual calm builds trust.

---

## 🛠️ PROTOTYPE: Make Ideas Tangible

### Prototype Approach

**Low-fidelity blueprint for rapid implementation** - Rather than creating mockups, we're defining concrete page-by-page changes that can be implemented directly in the existing Next.js/React codebase. This allows for faster iteration and real-world testing.

**Rough beats polished at this stage** - We're testing assumptions, not falling in love with first drafts. The goal is to validate the three core concepts (Exclusive Principal, Progressive Disclosure, Restrained Aesthetic) before refining.

---

### Prototype Description

## CONCEPT B: Exclusive Principal Positioning
*Messaging & Positioning Changes*

#### Hero Section
- **Headline:** "Principal-Led Salesforce Modernization" or "Embedded RevOps Partner for Series B+ SaaS"
- **Subhead:** "I take on 2-3 clients at a time. Deep focus. No handoffs. 6-16 weeks to production stability."
- **Add:** "Currently working with [2-3 anonymized client contexts]" below CTA
- **Remove:** Any apologetic or diminishing language

#### Differentiators Section
- **Rename section:** "Why Principal-Led Wins" or "The Embedded Partner Model"
- **Update card #1:** "100% US-Based, **Principal-Led**" (not "Boutique")
- **Reframe tone:** Not "small but good" → "Selective because expertise"
- **Add visual:** "Typical Agency: 8-12 team members | Revelate: 1 principal who knows your system"

#### Outcomes Section
- **Lead with concrete client outcomes** (anonymized):
  - "Series B Media-Tech: 120hrs/month saved, $200K annual waste eliminated"
  - "Series C SaaS: Forecast accuracy from 35% to 92% in 8 weeks"
  - "Early-stage unicorn: Modernization backlog cleared in 12 weeks"
- **Industry benchmarks move to sub-text** or tooltip: "(Industry avg: only 20% forecast within 5%)"

---

## CONCEPT C: Progressive Disclosure + Motion
*Interaction & Hierarchy Changes*

#### Pattern for Every Section:
```
[Bold Headline - 7-second comprehension]
  ↓
[3 bullet summary points - scannable]
  ↓
["Learn more >" expansion] ← Click/hover for full detail
```

#### Differentiators Section:
- **Initial View:** Just 4 icon + headline cards (no body text visible)
- **Interaction:** Click/hover card → Expands to show detail
- **Motion:** Subtle parallax as you scroll past (cards drift at different speeds)

#### Comparison Section:
- **Headline:** "Two Paths: Traditional Agency vs Embedded Principal"
- **Initial View:** Side-by-side visual comparison (icons, not text walls)
- **Interaction:** "See detailed comparison >" → Full table expands
- **Motion:** Parallax on gradient backgrounds

#### FAQ Section:
- **Show FAQ headlines only** (collapsed accordion)
- **Add search box:** "Quick question? Search here..."
- **Interaction:** Click headline → Expands that single FAQ
- **Motion:** Smooth height animation on expand/collapse

#### Sticky Navigation:
- Add sticky header showing current section as you scroll
- Sections: "Why Drew" | "Approach" | "Process" | "FAQ" | "Book Call"
- Current section highlighted in cyan
- Click to jump to section

---

## CONCEPT E: Restrained Space Aesthetic
*Visual Design Changes*

#### Gradient/Blur Reduction Rules:

**PROTOTYPE RULES:**
- **One signature gradient per page** (not per section)
  - Homepage: Single cyan gradient top-right that subtly shifts as you scroll
  - Book page: Single magenta gradient top-center
- **Reduce blur:** 170px → 60-80px maximum
- **Eliminate:** 75% of secondary/tertiary gradients
- **Keep:** Grid overlays, constellation dots (subtle)

#### Hero Section:
```css
/* REMOVE */
- Multiple overlapping gradient orbs
- Heavy blur effects on every layer
- Competing color temperatures

/* ADD/KEEP */
- ONE subtle cyan gradient (top-right, 60px blur, 12% opacity)
- Constellation dot pattern (very subtle, 0.3 opacity)
- Clean grid overlay on dark background
```

#### Differentiator Cards:
```css
/* PROTOTYPE */
- Clean white/light background
- Single subtle gradient on card hover only
- One consistent shadow: 0 6px 12px rgba(17,27,58,0.12)
- Icon gets cyan accent on hover (not background gradient)
```

#### Comparison Section:
```css
/* PROTOTYPE */
- Match card style from differentiators (visual consistency)
- Subtle color coding: Left card has cyan accent border (2px)
- Right card has neutral gray border
- Same shadow, same spacing, same typography
```

#### Book Page:
```css
/* PROTOTYPE */
- Lighter, cleaner dark (from-[#1a1f3a] to-[#11152d])
- ONE magenta gradient (top-center, 70px blur, 14% opacity)
- Remove or reduce noise texture to 0.005 opacity
- Grid pattern stays but more subtle
```

### Key Features to Test

1. **Principal-Led Language:** Does it build trust or create confusion?
2. **Progressive Disclosure:** Do visitors actually click "Learn more" or do they need everything visible?
3. **Restrained Aesthetic:** Does it feel more professional and trustworthy?
4. **7-Second Rule:** Can visitors grasp each section's point immediately?
5. **Motion & Parallax:** Does it enhance engagement or become distracting?
6. **Exclusivity Positioning:** Does "I take 2-3 clients at a time" signal expertise or limitation?
7. **Visual Consistency:** Does the unified design language feel cohesive across all sections?

---

## ✅ TEST: Validate with Users

### Testing Plan

**Philosophy:** Observing what users DO matters infinitely more than what they SAY. Watch behavior, not just opinions.

**Who to Test With (5-7 people):**
- 2-3 RevOps leaders (Series B+ SaaS)
- 2-3 Sales VPs (experiencing scaling pain)
- 1-2 founders (technical debt challenges)

**Where to Find Them:**
- LinkedIn network (ask for 15 minutes of feedback)
- RevOps communities/Slack groups
- Previous prospects who didn't convert

---

**Test Tasks:**

**Task 1: "Can you figure out what I do in 10 seconds?"**
- Show homepage, count to 10 silently
- Ask: "What does Revelate offer?"
- **Success:** They can articulate it accurately

**Task 2: "You need Salesforce help. Would you book a call?"**
- Let them scroll/explore naturally
- Watch where they pause, what they click
- Have them think aloud
- **Success:** They understand value and feel confident booking

**Task 3: "What would you want to know before booking?"**
- Note: These are your progressive disclosure opportunities
- **Success:** The information they need is accessible

**Task 4: "What's your first impression?"**
- Show homepage 3 seconds, then hide
- Ask: "What did you notice? How did it feel?"
- **Success:** "Professional," "Trustworthy," "Sophisticated" (not "overwhelming")

---

**Key Questions:**

**About Positioning:**
- "When you see 'I take 2-3 clients at a time,' what does that signal?"
  - ✓ "Exclusive, focused, high-quality"
  - ✗ "Too small, can't scale, unavailable"

**About Progressive Disclosure:**
- "Did you click 'Learn more'? Why or why not?"
- "Was there information you wanted but couldn't find quickly?"

**About Visual Design:**
- "How does this compare to other consultants?"
- "Does it feel boutique or established?"

**About Trust:**
- "Scale 1-10, how confident would you feel booking?"
- "What would increase your confidence?"

### Riskiest Assumptions to Validate

1. **"Principal-Led" signals expertise** (not "too small")
   - Test: Does "2-3 clients at a time" build trust?

2. **Progressive disclosure is desired** (not frustrating)
   - Test: Do they click "Learn more" or bounce?

3. **Restrained aesthetic feels trustworthy** (not empty)
   - Test: First impression - professional or unfinished?

4. **7-second comprehension is achievable**
   - Test: Can they grasp each section's point that fast?

5. **Concrete outcomes > industry stats**
   - Test: What convinced them you could help?
