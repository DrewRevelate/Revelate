## What This Means

**You've shipped the complete redesign in ONE DAY.**

Everything from the design thinking session is now live:
- ✅ Exclusive Principal positioning
- ✅ Progressive disclosure with motion
- ✅ Restrained space aesthetic
- ✅ 7-second comprehension goal
- ✅ Visual proof over verbal promises
- ✅ Trust architecture built

**The only thing left is Phase 3: User Testing**

---

## PHASE 3: User Testing (Next Step)

### What You Need to Do:

#### 1. Recruit 5-7 Testers (1-2 hours)
Target profiles:
- 2-3 RevOps leaders (Series B+ SaaS)
- 2-3 Sales VPs (experiencing scaling pain)
- 1-2 founders (tech debt challenges)

Where to find them:
- LinkedIn connections
- RevOps communities/Slack groups
- Past prospects who didn't convert

**Outreach template:**
```
Hey [Name],

Quick favor - I just redesigned my website and need 15 minutes of brutal honesty from someone who actually deals with RevOps/Salesforce chaos.

No pitch, no sales. Just show you the site, watch you click around, and ask what makes sense vs what confuses you.

Coffee on me (virtually) if you have time this week?

- Drew
```

#### 2. Prepare Testing Materials (30 min)
- [ ] Copy testing script from design-thinking doc
- [ ] Create Feedback Capture Grid spreadsheet/doc
- [ ] Set up screen recording (if remote): Zoom, Loom, or browser extension

---

#### 3. Run Tests (3-4 hours total)
**Per session (30 minutes each):**
- 5 min: Intro + context
- 15 min: 4 testing tasks (observe behavior, ask them to think aloud)
- 10 min: Follow-up questions

**Tasks to run:**
1. "Can you figure out what I do in 10 seconds?" (Show homepage, count to 10, ask)
2. "You need Salesforce help. Would you book a call?" (Let them explore, watch behavior)
3. "What would you want to know before booking?" (Note gaps)
4. "What's your first impression?" (Show 3 seconds, hide, ask reaction)

**Questions to ask:**
- "When you see 'I take 2-3 clients at a time,' what does that signal?"
- "Did you click any 'Learn more' sections? Why or why not?"
- "How does this compare to other consultants you've considered?"
- "Scale 1-10, how confident would you feel booking a call?"

---

#### 4. Analyze Patterns (1 hour)
- What did 3+ people struggle with?
- What surprised them (good or bad)?
- What questions kept coming up?
- What convinced them vs what didn't?

**Look for:**
- Confusion points
- Missing information
- Trust signals that worked/didn't work
- Visual elements that helped/hurt

---

#### 5. Fix Top 3 Friction Points (2-4 hours)
Based on patterns, make targeted fixes.

**Don't redesign** - just remove friction.

---

#### 6. Retest + Ship (1 hour)
- Show 2 users the fixes
- Confirm improvement
- Deploy to production
- Announce update

---

## Success Metrics (From Design Thinking)

After testing, you should be able to answer:

### Validation Metrics
- [ ] Can 5/7 users explain what you do in 10 seconds?
- [ ] Does trust rating average 8+ out of 10?
- [ ] Does "Principal-Led" signal expertise (not "too small")?
- [ ] Does restrained aesthetic feel professional?
- [ ] Do visitors use progressive disclosure features?

### Riskiest Assumptions to Test
1. **"Principal-Led" signals expertise** - Does "2-3 clients at a time" build trust or concern?
2. **Progressive disclosure is desired** - Do they click "Learn more" or want everything visible?
3. **Restrained aesthetic feels trustworthy** - Professional or empty/unfinished?
4. **7-second comprehension works** - Can they grasp each section's point that fast?
5. **Concrete outcomes > industry stats** - What convinced them you could help?
