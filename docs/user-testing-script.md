## INTRODUCTION (5 minutes)

### Say This:

> "Hey [Name], thanks for doing this. I'm going to show you my website and get your honest reaction. There are no wrong answers - actually, the more critical you are, the more helpful it is for me.
>
> A few ground rules:
> - **Think out loud** as much as you can. Tell me what you're noticing, what confuses you, what makes sense.
> - **Be brutally honest** - I'd rather hear it now than after I launch.
> - **This is not a test of you** - if something is confusing, that's my fault, not yours.
>
> I'm going to ask you to do a few specific tasks, then we'll just talk about what you saw. Sound good?"

### If They Ask "What do you want feedback on?":
> "Everything. Layout, messaging, whether it's clear what I do, whether you'd actually book a call - all of it."
