# About Revelate Operations

## The Problem With Most Consultants

Most consultants show up, diagnose problems, propose expensive platform replacements, and leave. Six months later, you're running on a system nobody understands, with technical debt you didn't have before.

That's not how growth-stage companies scale.

## What We Do Differently

Revelate Operations specializes in **revenue architecture resets** for Series B SaaS companies with $10-50M ARR. We don't rebuild your systems. We fix them.

Our focus: **brownfield redesigns** that improve what you already have. No new platforms. No unnecessary licenses. No starting from zero.

We solve the structural problems that create unreliable ARR reporting, billing errors, and hundreds of wasted hours on manual reconciliation. The problems that compound every month leadership ignores them.

## The Revelate Approach

**Systematic Discovery**  
We map your entire data ecosystem before touching anything. Salesforce, NetSuite, backend systems, integration layers. We interview sales, ops, BI, finance, and product teams to understand where systems conflict and where processes break.

**Root Cause Architecture**  
We don't treat symptoms. If your ARR reporting is inconsistent, we trace it back to conflicting customer definitions across systems. If your sales team can't identify whitespace, we rebuild visibility into brand penetration and location hierarchies.

**Measured Outcomes**  
Every engagement targets quantifiable business impact. Cost avoidance. Revenue unlocked. Hours recaptured. We structure proposals with clear ROI timelines and break-even projections.

## Real Results

Current client engagements include:

- **Rockbot ($30M Series B):** Revenue Architecture Reset addressing $200K+ annual cost bleed from manual reconciliation and conflicting ARR definitions across Salesforce, NetSuite, and backend systems.

- **Debticate (FinTech SaaS):** Azure AD SSO implementation, Salesforce Data Cloud integration with AWS infrastructure, and AgentForce AI deployment for conversational intelligence.

- **22Q Family Foundation (Nonprofit):** Complete donation system migration from GiveSmart to Stripe with Salesforce integration, Nonprofit Cloud deployment, and community portal implementation.

## Technical Depth

7+ years of Salesforce ecosystem expertise. 300+ Trailhead badges. Deep implementation experience across:

- **Salesforce:** Sales Cloud, Data Cloud, Nonprofit Cloud, AgentForce AI, Lightning Sync
- **Enterprise Integration:** NetSuite ERP, Azure AD, AWS PrivateLink, Boomi middleware
- **Security & Compliance:** SSO architecture, SAML configuration, HIPAA/SOC 2/PCI-DSS patterns
- **Revenue Operations:** CPQ, subscription management, complex account hierarchies, partner attribution modeling

## Why Series B Companies Work With Us

At your stage, you've outgrown scrappy solutions but can't afford enterprise consulting rates or multi-month rebuild projects. Your systems work just enough that replacing them feels risky, but they're creating compounding problems.

We understand this position because we focus exclusively on companies at your stage. We know how to evolve systems without disrupting the business. We know which shortcuts need unwinding and which can stay.

## How We Work

**Fixed-Hour Engagements:** $75-110/hour structured as project packages ($12K-$70K typical range). You know costs upfront. No scope creep.

**2-3 Active Clients:** We deliberately limit capacity to maintain deep focus. You're not competing with 20 other projects for attention.

**Documentation-First:** Every discovery session produces detailed notes. Every design decision includes rationale. Every implementation includes runbooks. When we're done, your team owns the knowledge.

**Stakeholder Coordination:** We navigate complex organizations. We facilitate alignment between technical teams, finance, sales ops, and executive leadership. We translate between business requirements and technical constraints.

## The Bottom Line

Revenue architecture problems don't fix themselves. They compound. Every month you delay addressing structural issues costs more than the month before.

We help Series B SaaS companies stop bleeding operational costs, unlock revenue trapped in poor visibility, and build sustainable systems that scale beyond the next funding round.

No platforms you don't need. No rebuild projects you can't afford. Just systematic fixes that deliver ROI within the first year.
