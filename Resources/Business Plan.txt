Revelate Operations LLC | Business Plan
Executive Summary
What do we do?
Revelate Operations is a fractional revenue operations company specializing in sales and marketing software, sales process improvements, and data analysis. Our offerings are uniquely structured: clients can purchase packages of hours to use according to their specific revenue operations needs. This flexible approach ensures our customers pay only for the services they require, avoiding unnecessary expenditures.
Why will this be successful?
Revelate Operations is poised for success by offering tailored access to expert services in sales, software, and data analysis, traditionally only accessible through full-time employees or consultants. This approach is particularly attractive in today's market, where Revenue Operations (RevOps) is rapidly gaining recognition as a critical business function. Many startups and small businesses recognize the value of RevOps, demonstrated by extensive research showing its significant impact on business growth. However, the high costs associated with maintaining a full-time RevOps team are often prohibitive for these smaller entities. Revelate addresses this gap by providing flexible, a la carte RevOps services. Clients can selectively invest in specific areas of RevOps according to their needs, enjoying all the advantages of a dedicated team without the financial burden of full-time hires. This cost-effective solution uniquely positions us to meet a growing demand in the market.
Mission Statement
At Revelate Operations, we believe that every business, regardless of size or resources, deserves the power to harness their data for strategic growth. Our mission is to break down the barriers in understanding and utilizing revenue operations, providing accessible and expert-driven solutions. We are dedicated to transforming the way businesses leverage their data, ensuring that informed, data-driven decisions are not a privilege of the few, but a fundamental right for all. By bridging the gap between complex revenue operations and practical, effective application, we empower companies to not just solve problems, but to proactively prevent them. Our goal is to redefine the landscape of revenue operations, making it an integral, understandable, and valued aspect of every business we partner with.
Management Structure
Revelate Operations LLC is a partnership, skillfully managed by co-founders and equal partners Melanie Tummino and Drew Lambert. Both partners bring distinct expertise and share the responsibility of decision-making, ensuring a balanced and dynamic leadership.


Melanie Tummino, with her extensive background in BI analytics, spearheads the data services division. She oversees all aspects of data storage, ETL processes, analysis, and modeling, ensuring excellence and innovation in these critical areas.


Drew Lambert leads the Sales Enablement, Software Implementation, and Marketing departments. His expertise in these fields guides the strategic direction and operational excellence of these key business areas.


This dual leadership structure not only leverages the unique strengths of each founder but also fosters a collaborative environment that is pivotal for agile decision-making and robust business growth. As Revelate Operations expands, we are committed to scaling our management team to meet the evolving needs of our clients and the market.

This growth will enable us to cater to a wider range of client needs and solidify our presence in the industry.

Company Description


What problem do we solve?
Revelate Operations tackles the critical challenge of inaccessibility to proficient revenue operations (RevOps) that many startups face. This inaccessibility manifests in several ways:


Financial Constraints
Startups often struggle with the high costs associated with implementing and maintaining advanced technologies. This includes the expense of hiring skilled staff to manage these technologies and analyze the resulting data.
Knowledge Gap
Many young companies lack a comprehensive understanding of what RevOps truly entails and the significant value it can add to their business. This gap in knowledge and expertise places them at a distinct disadvantage compared to larger, more established competitors with dedicated RevOps teams.


Revelate Operations addresses these barriers by offering startups direct access to expert RevOps services. Our model is designed to level the playing field, allowing smaller companies to leverage the same caliber of data analysis and operational efficiency as their larger counterparts, but without the prohibitive costs. We provide a solution that helps startups not only survive but thrive in an environment where technological advancements in sales, marketing, and data analysis can often disproportionately benefit larger organizations. Our services ensure that these advancements are an opportunity for growth for all businesses, regardless of their size.
Why does our target audience need our services?
The core necessity of our services for our target audience stems from the hidden potential within their businesses. Many companies are unaware of the valuable data they possess. This data, when correctly identified and harnessed, can be a game-changer.


Revelate Operations specializes in uncovering and utilizing this latent potential. We guide businesses in recognizing and extracting value from their data, akin to finding and efficiently drilling for oil. Our expertise lies not just in identifying this resource but also in implementing the processes and technologies needed to access it.


Once this data is brought to the surface, our role evolves. We don't just leave businesses with raw data; we transform it into actionable insights. Like an artist turning vibrant paints into a compelling masterpiece, we analyze and interpret this data, turning it into a narrative that makes sense for the business. This process illuminates the path for strategic decisions, painting a clear picture of where the business stands and where it could go.


In essence, Revelate Operations equips businesses with the tools and expertise to unlock their potential and visualize their path to success. We offer a comprehensive solution that not only reveals hidden data resources but also refines them into actionable strategies for growth and decision-making.


How will we outperform our competitors?
Revelate Operations sets itself apart in the competitive landscape through a blend of our dynamic pricing model and a deeply ingrained service culture that challenges the typical consultant-client dynamic.
Dynamic Pricing Model
Our approach to pricing is tailored to meet the diverse needs of our client base. From startups to Fortune 100 companies, our pricing structure is designed to be adaptive and accommodating. This flexibility allows us to offer affordable options for smaller businesses while also catering to the complex needs of larger organizations with more resource-intensive requirements.
Subscription Flexibility
Our subscription packages, available in varying hourly allotments over different periods, provide clients with the ability to precisely match our services to their current needs and budgetary constraints. This flexibility ensures that businesses of all sizes can access top-tier RevOps services without facing financial strain.
Cultural Differentiation
Beyond pricing, what truly distinguishes us is our commitment to being an integral part of our clients’ teams. Unlike traditional consultants who may have a transient, uninvested presence, we immerse ourselves in the cultures and goals of the companies we work with. We're not just service providers; we are partners who share in the successes and challenges of our clients.
Proactive and Preventive Approach
Our philosophy centers on not just solving problems as they arise but proactively preventing them. This approach enables us to offer more than just solutions; we provide strategic foresight and long-term stability, aligning closely with our clients’ objectives.
Market Reach and Competitiveness
The combination of our competitive pricing and deep client integration allows us to tap into a broad market segment. We’re positioned to attract a wide range of businesses, offering them both financial accessibility and a partnership that traditional consultancy models fail to deliver.


In essence, Revelate Operations outperforms competitors by offering a unique synergy of cost-effective, flexible pricing and a service ethos that places client success at the heart of our operations. This dual approach not only makes our services accessible to a wide range of businesses but also ensures that we deliver value far beyond traditional revenue operations support.
