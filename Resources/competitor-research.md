# Competitor Research: Revelate Operations
**Date:** October 26, 2025
**Focus:** Salesforce Consulting for Series B SaaS Companies

---

## Executive Summary

The Salesforce consulting market is dominated by large firms and boutique agencies, but there's significant demand for specialized, solo consultants who can deliver personalized service at competitive rates. Drew's positioning as a "brownfield modernization" specialist fills a unique gap—most consultants either push expensive rebuilds or lack the technical depth for surgical fixes.

**Key Opportunity:** The market is saturated with consultants who recommend complete rebuilds. Drew's "fix not rebuild" approach addresses a real pain point with minimal direct competition using this positioning.

## 3. Positioning Analysis

### Current Market Positioning Themes

**Most Common Positioning:**
1. **"Digital Transformation"** - Vague, overused
2. **"Salesforce Experts"** - Generic, no differentiation
3. **"Industry Specialists"** - Healthcare, finance, retail focus
4. **"Full-Service Partner"** - Comprehensive solutions, soup-to-nuts

### Brownfield vs. Greenfield Reality

**Key Finding:** "Brownfield implementations are much more common than greenfield projects"

**Market Observation:** "Significant brownfield remediation cleanup work in the industry from consultants fixing previous implementations"

**Opportunity:** Most consultants pitch greenfield (rebuild) because it's more profitable. Drew's brownfield specialization addresses the actual market need.

### Technical Debt Market

**Pain Point Validated:**
- "Requirements from customers keep changing... metadata not included in final implementation still remains in the org unused, causing technical debt"
- Common issues: Inactive rules, unused assets, stale reports, forgotten customizations
- **Nobody positioning as "technical debt cleanup specialist"** - this is Drew's white space

**Tools Available:** Technical Debt Center, Technicaldebts.com
- Suggests this is a known, painful problem
- Creates opportunity for consultant who specializes in fixes

### What's Missing in the Market

**1. "Fix Not Rebuild" Positioning**
- **Search Results:** Zero consultants explicitly positioning this way

**4. Series C Operator Experience**
- **Market:** Consultants have consulting experience
- **Drew:** 3+ years owning Salesforce at $100M+ Series C
- **Advantage:** "I've lived your exact scaling problems"

**5. Brownfield Modernization as Service Line**

## Conclusion

Drew is well-positioned in a gap in the market: **experienced solo consultant with deep technical skills, Series C operator background, and unique "brownfield modernization" positioning.**

The competitive landscape is fragmented between expensive agencies and generic solo consultants. Nobody is explicitly positioning as "fix not rebuild" specialist for Series B SaaS companies, despite this being:
- A real market need (brownfield > greenfield in practice)
- A validated pain point (technical debt remediation)
- An underserved segment (Series B gets pitch for rebuilds)

**Primary competitive advantage:** Drew's not competing on breadth (like agencies) or price (like offshore/junior consultants). He's competing on **surgical precision + operator credibility + transparent value delivery.**

The website messaging is already strong. Next steps should focus on:
1. Content/SEO to own the "brownfield modernization" positioning
2. Case study development to prove methodology
3. Potentially adjusting pricing upward to reflect unique value
4. Building awareness in Series B SaaS community
