## Outreach Strategy Recommendations

### Timing
Companies just raised Series B in **January 2026** — they're in "build and scale" mode RIGHT NOW. The next 30-60 days is the optimal window before they hire full-time RevOps or commit to an agency.

### Key Signal to Watch For
- **Hiring for VP Sales, VP Revenue Operations, or Salesforce Admin** = they know they need help but haven't filled the role yet. Perfect timing for a consultant.
- **Job postings mentioning "Salesforce," "CRM migration," or "GTM operations"** = active pain point.

### Recommended Outreach Sequence
1. **LinkedIn connection + comment** on their funding announcement
2. **Warm email** to VP Sales, CRO, or CEO referencing the raise and a specific pain point
3. **Loom video** with a 2-minute teardown of a RevOps challenge they likely face at their stage
4. **Follow-up** with a case study (Bevi results: 2+ hrs → 3 min routing, 66% sales acceleration)

### Where to Find Contact Info
- **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** — search for VP Sales, CRO, Head of RevOps at each company
- **Apollo.io** — verified emails
- **Fundraise Insider** / **GrowthList** — CEO contacts for recently funded companies
