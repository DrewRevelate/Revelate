## Post 1: "The Series B CRM Reckoning"

**Topic:** Why Series B is when Salesforce breaks
**Goal:** Position as the expert for this exact moment
**Best time to post:** Tuesday or Wednesday, 8-10am ET

---

Your Salesforce org worked fine at Series A.

You had 15 reps. A couple automations. One admin who "knew where everything was."

Then you raised your B.

Now you have 40 reps across two segments. Three new integrations nobody documented. A forecasting model that drifts 20%+ every Monday. And that admin? They left six months ago.

This is the Series B CRM reckoning. It happens to almost every SaaS company between $10M and $50M ARR.

Here's what I see when I audit these orgs:

→ Routing rules that reference fields nobody uses anymore
→ Apex triggers from 2021 that nobody understands
→ Marketing automation that fires on the wrong lifecycle stages
→ Finance reconciliation that requires a manual spreadsheet

The fix isn't a 9-month rebuild. It's a 6-16 week modernization sprint. Map the automations. Stabilize production. Wire observability. Hand off clean.

I've done this at a $100M+ Series C (2+ hour routing → 3 minutes, 66% sales cycle acceleration). The pattern is the same at Series B — just earlier and cheaper to fix.

If your Salesforce org is held together with tribal knowledge and good luck, let's talk before the next board meeting.

## Post 2: "The Hidden Cost of 'Good Enough' Data"

**Topic:** Data quality and revenue impact
**Goal:** Educate + establish thought leadership
**Best time to post:** Thursday, 8-10am ET

---

Your CRM data is costing you more than you think.

Here's what the research says:

• 91% of CRM data is incomplete or missing critical fields (Validity, 2024)
• Companies lose $12.9M annually to poor data quality (Gartner)
• Sales reps spend 72% of their time on non-selling activities (Salesforce)

But the real cost isn't in the stats. It's in the meetings.

The Monday forecast call where the VP of Sales and the CFO are looking at different numbers. The board deck that gets rebuilt in Google Sheets because nobody trusts the dashboard. The deal that slipped because routing sent it to the wrong rep for three days.

Every company I've worked with has a version of this story. The difference between the ones that fix it and the ones that don't? Usually one bad quarter.

Revenue operations isn't a cost center. It's insurance against the quarter where your data lies to the board.

## Post 3: "Why I Left a $100M Company to Do This Solo"

**Topic:** Personal story / founder journey
**Goal:** Build personal brand + trust
**Best time to post:** Monday, 8-10am ET

---

In 2024, I was a Senior Revenue Systems Engineer at a $100M+ Series C company.

I built 150+ workflow implementations in 12 weeks. Cut lead routing from 2+ hours to 3 minutes. Helped accelerate sales cycles by 66%.

Then I asked myself: why does only one company get to benefit from this?

The truth is, most Series B SaaS companies can't afford a full-time senior revenue systems engineer. But they desperately need one.

Their Salesforce org was set up by a well-meaning SDR three years ago. Their integrations are held together with Zapier and prayers. Their forecast is a vibes check, not a data-driven process.

So I started Revelate Operations. One principal consultant. 2-3 clients max. No offshore teams. No junior handoffs. No nine-month rebuilds.

Just the same expertise I brought to a $100M company, available to the Series B companies that need it most.

A year in, here's what I've learned:

1. The problems are remarkably similar across companies
2. The fix is almost never a full rebuild
3. Documentation is the most underrated deliverable in consulting
4. Working directly with the team (not through layers) produces better results

If you're a Series B SaaS founder or RevOps leader wrestling with a Salesforce org that's outgrown its architecture — that's exactly why I exist.

## Post 4: "5 Signs Your Revenue Stack Is About to Break"

**Topic:** Diagnostic content / lead generation
**Goal:** Generate inbound inquiries
**Best time to post:** Wednesday, 8-10am ET

---

Your revenue stack gives you warning signs before it breaks.

Here are 5 I see in almost every Series B audit:

𝟭. Your forecast and your CRM tell different stories
If your VP Sales exports to a spreadsheet before every board meeting, your CRM isn't the source of truth. It's a suggestion box.

𝟮. Nobody touches the automations
"Don't change that Flow — it'll break something" is the most expensive sentence in RevOps. If your team is afraid to modify production, you've got a maintenance debt problem.

𝟯. New hires take 3+ weeks to get CRM access configured
Onboarding complexity is a proxy for system complexity. If it takes an act of Congress to set up a new rep, your permission model is probably a house of cards.

𝟰. Marketing and sales blame each other for lead quality
This is almost always a lifecycle stage + routing problem, not a people problem. When MQLs aren't defined in the system the same way they're defined in the strategy deck, everyone's right and nobody wins.

𝟱. Your integrations run on someone's memory
If the person who set up your Salesforce ↔ NetSuite sync left the company, and nobody knows how it works — you're one error away from a revenue reconciliation nightmare.

If you're nodding at 3+ of these: your stack isn't broken yet, but the cracks are showing.

The good news? These are all fixable in weeks, not months.

## Post 5: "The Agency vs. Embedded Partner Decision"

**Topic:** Positioning against large agencies
**Goal:** Differentiate Revelate's model
**Best time to post:** Tuesday, 8-10am ET

---

Every VP of RevOps at a scaling SaaS company faces this decision:

Hire a big agency? Or an embedded principal?

Here's the honest comparison:

THE AGENCY MODEL:
• 8-12 team members across time zones
• Junior developers do the actual work
• 9-month rebuild timeline
• $50K-$200K total cost
• You get a project manager, not a practitioner

THE EMBEDDED PRINCIPAL MODEL:
• 1 senior practitioner who knows your system
• 6-16 week modernization sprints
• Production improvements ship weekly
• You get detailed time logs on demand
• The person who audits your org is the person who fixes it

I'm biased — I run the second model. But here's why I think it's better for Series B SaaS:

At your stage, you don't need a team of 12. You need one person who understands the entire revenue stack end-to-end. Someone who can sit in your standup, pair on your tickets, and ship fixes alongside your admin.

When you're a $200M company with 500 reps, hire the agency. When you're $10-50M ARR with 30-150 reps and a Salesforce org that's outgrown its architecture? Hire the practitioner.

What's been your experience with agencies vs. solo consultants? I'd genuinely love to hear.

## Usage Notes for Drew

- **Edit freely** — these are drafts, not final copy. Add your own stories and examples.
- **One per week** is a good cadence to start. Tuesday-Thursday mornings perform best.
- **Engage in comments** for 30 min after posting — the algorithm rewards early engagement.
- **Tag relevant people** — if you mention a concept someone else wrote about, tag them.
- **Avoid hashtag spam** — 3-5 relevant hashtags max.
- **Add a photo or graphic** — posts with images get 2x engagement. A simple brand-colored quote card works.
